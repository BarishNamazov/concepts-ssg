/**
 * Shared authorization helpers for the privileged "admin" endpoints.
 *
 * Several concepts expose globally privileged operations — managing roles,
 * locking threads, trashing content, and curating categories. Authorizing each
 * one by hand (resolve the session, check a capability, fail otherwise) is the
 * same dance the flag and pin syncs already perform inline; these helpers
 * capture it once so every privileged endpoint enforces it identically.
 *
 * Authority lives in the global {@link FORUM_CONTEXT} Roling context: a user may
 * perform a privileged action when they hold the required capability there.
 *
 * **Bootstrap.** A brand-new forum has no administrators, so demanding the
 * capability up front would lock everyone out forever. Auth syncs automatically
 * grant the sole registered user an administrator role; until someone holds the
 * {@link ADMIN_CAPABILITY} in the forum context the gate also stays *open* for
 * manual recovery. The moment an administrator exists the forum is "claimed"
 * and enforcement kicks in for good.
